Review of initial Service:
https://github.com/durrani/java-backend-interview/blob/afeeb801838e3c1ba0d11072723ab066c3db521a/src/main/java/com/nutrition/service/NutritionSearchService.java

Filtering Logic:
The current filter is a placeholder (item -> true). Hence as instructed, I have implemented actual filtering based on request parameters (e.g., calories, fat rating).

Separation of Concern:
Move CSV handling into its own repository class. Hence as instructed, I have implemented this.

Error Handling:
Use a custom exception (like CsvFileLoadingException) instead of a generic RuntimeException for better clarity.

Repository Abstraction:
For better testability and flexibility, consider abstracting file access behind a repository interface.

Logging:
Add logging for file loading, errors and key operations to aid in debugging and monitoring.

Validation:
Add more robust validation for input fields and error messages for malformed CSV rows.

Sort & Limit order:
These should be interchanged, in the order first sort and then limit.

Comparator:
Keep business logic in the NutritionSearchService and move out Comparator to its own class(can be shared across multiple Services if required).

Hard coded values:
Values like 100g, 17.5 and 3 can be moved to either constants or to a configurable in application.properties.

Unwanted code:
rowData.get(SERVING_SIZE).equals("100 g") seems to be redundant as it seems nutrition.csv does not contain any other service size.
Command:
findstr /V /C:"100 g" src\main\resources\nutrition.csv

Unit test:
Add more unit tests and make sure coverage is measured using Sonar Qube.

Libraries:
May consider using mapping library like MapStruct and lombok for builder pattern.
